## Understand the data [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Lina-statistics/Springboard-Capstone-Projects/blob/main/drug_review/drug_review_EDA.ipynb) [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Lina-statistics/Springboard-Capstone-Projects/blob/main/drug_review/drug_review_EDA_2.ipynb) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54960730/121743131-d759ea80-cace-11eb-9460-2e0477e19646.png)

* How big is the data set? What information is provided in this data set? 
* How many conditions were mentioned in this data set? What's the top conditions with most reviews? Is there any time dependent trend for condition? How many drugs were included in this dataset?  Which drugs have most reviews? What are the top drugs with high ratings? Which drugs in the top condition categories have most reviews?  Are there multiple drugs used for the same condition? Are there multiple conditions using the same drug? How is the rating distributed in this dataset across date? Which rating have the most reviews? Do drugs treated certain condition have highest rating? Is high rating reviews necessarily associated with high usefulCounts? What is the distribution of review length across rating, condition, usefulCount and date? etc.
* Which stopword set should we use for our wordcloud analysis in natural language processing?  What's the most frequent meaningful words in these reviews? Can we catch a glimpse of their content using wordcloud plot? Based on the reviews, can we get a general impression about those pain killer pills? Are they effective? Do people complain their side effects? What are their side effects? Which ones are the most effective? Which ones have a lot of complaint? Â What if we separate these reviews into the one with good rating and the one with bad rating? Can we extract more meaningful information from those reviews? Which wordcloud can give us more information about the drugs, unigram, bigram or trigram?

## Feature engineering [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Lina-statistics/Springboard-Capstone-Projects/blob/main/drug_review/drug_review_feature_engineering.ipynb)
* How can we extract useful features from the review column of the data? ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54960730/121743002-a5488880-cace-11eb-881c-21db03c3bc16.png)

## Regression modeling [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Lina-statistics/Springboard-Capstone-Projects/blob/main/drug_review/drug_review_rating_model.ipynb) 
* Can we develop a proper regression model to predict the rating of the reviews? ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54960730/121743606-99a99180-cacf-11eb-84b2-14cf9e22410d.png)

## Classification modeling [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Lina-statistics/Springboard-Capstone-Projects/blob/main/drug_review/drug_review_classification_model.ipynb)
* What if we convert the problem into a classification one? Can we get good results? ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54960730/121744165-7c28f780-cad0-11eb-9b48-50a53747c861.png)
